# About USA Mathematical Olympiad

The USAMO (United States of America Mathematics Olympiad) provides a means of identifying and encouraging the most creative secondary mathematics students in the country. It serves to indicate the talent of those who may become leaders in the mathematical sciences of the next generation. The USAMO is part of a worldwide system of national mathematics competitions, a movement in which both educators and research mathematicians are engaged in recognizing and celebrating the imagination and resourcefulness of our youth.
The USAMO is a six question 6 hour essay/proof examination. All problems can be solved with pre-calculus methods. Approximately 200 of the top scoring AMC participants (based on a weighted average) are invited to take the USAMO. Participation on the USAMO will be limited to American citizens or permanent residents in other words, those seeking citizenship and currently possessing a U.S.A. Immigration "green card".
